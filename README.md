# to-do-list
to-do list with kotlin - santander bootcamp 2021

The idea here is to create a repository for the final project of the bootcamp santander 2021, so I thought it was better to leave the files all in a single directory and together, so as not to run it, but only as a cloud storage of used codes and learning of them, so that other participants have the job of creating them as a project and code their own with the classes, even if they can use it here as a query for comparison or analysis only.
